# Cucumber Test Automation Framework

A sample **Cucumber BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)** automation framework built using Java, Selenium, and Cucumber.

This project demonstrates how to write readable and maintainable automated test scenarios using Gherkin syntax and Cucumber step definitions.

## 🧠 About This Framework

This repository includes:

- `.feature` files written in Gherkin (Given/When/Then syntax)
- Step definitions linked to feature steps
- Selenium WebDriver integration for browser automation
- Test runner configuration (Cucumber + TestNG/JUnit)
- Maven for dependency management

BDD approach makes test scenarios easy to read for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
